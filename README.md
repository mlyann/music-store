# Music Library App (CSC 335 LA1)

Welcome to the **Music Library App**! This console-based Java application allows you to manage a music library, search for songs/albums, create playlists, rate songs, and maintain a list of favorites. It is a project for **CSC 335 LA1**, taught by **Instructor Malenie Lotz** with the assistance of **TA Jenny Yu**. The authors of this project are **Haocheng Cao** and **Minglai Yang**.

## Overview

The **Music Library App** is a simple command-line interface (CLI) program that simulates the functionalities of managing music data:

- **Search and load songs** from a "Store" into a local user library.
- **View and handle albums** within the store or user library.
- **Create and manage playlists**, add or remove songs, and play them.
- **Rate songs** and mark them as favorites.
- **View your entire library** of songs, albums, artists, and more.

This project helps students practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and Java coding skills by simulating a real-world application with menus, data manipulation, and user interactions.

```
la1/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MainUI.java         // The main class containing the CLI flow (menus, input, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MusicStore.java     // Manages store-related data (songs, albums available to load)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LibraryModel.java   // Core logic for the user‚Äôs library, playlists, favorites, rating
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Song.java           // Represents a single Song entity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Album.java          // Represents an Album entity containing multiple songs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TablePrinter.java   // Utility class for printing tables in the console
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 
```
- **MainUI**  
  Contains all the user interface logic and menu navigation in a console environment.

- **MusicStore**  
  Manages a collection of available songs/albums that can be loaded into the user library.

- **LibraryModel**  
  Core business logic and data handling for user‚Äôs library, playlists, favorites, and ratings.

- **Song** / **Album**  
  Data model classes representing individual songs and albums.

- **TablePrinter**  
  Utility class used for formatting and printing lists of data in a table-like structure to the console.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java 8** or higher installed on your system.
- A Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code) or the ability to compile via the command line.

### Installation & Compilation
1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mlyann/music-store.git
    ```
	2.	Open the project in your preferred IDE or navigate into the project folder via terminal:
    ```bash
    cd music-store
    ```

	3.	Ensure that the package structure (la1) is respected if you are using an IDE.
	4.	Compile the code (if using command line):
    ```bash
    javac la1/*.java
    ```


Running the Application
‚Ä¢	After compilation, run the main application class:

java la1.MainUI

How to Use

Once you run the program:
1.	Main Menu
‚Ä¢	Search (Songs/Albums in Store or Library)
‚Ä¢	PlayingList (a quick, single ‚Äúnow-playing‚Äù playlist)
‚Ä¢	View all PlayLists (manages multiple playlists)
‚Ä¢	Favorite List (view/edit your favorite songs)
‚Ä¢	Library Lists (shows all songs/albums/artists in your library)
‚Ä¢	Load Songs (manually input song data)
‚Ä¢	Quit the application
2.	Navigating the Menus
Use the numeric options presented to you in the console to navigate between submenus. Press 0 (zero) to go back or exit, and follow the on-screen prompts.
3.	Adding/Removing Songs
‚Ä¢	Enter songs manually via the Load Songs option.
‚Ä¢	Search the Store for songs or albums by a keyword, then add them to your library.
4.	Creating & Managing Playlists
‚Ä¢	Create new playlists, open existing ones, and add/remove songs.
‚Ä¢	Shuffle or play an entire playlist.
5.	Favorites & Rating
‚Ä¢	Rate a song from 1 to 5.
‚Ä¢	Songs rated 5 will automatically become favorites.
‚Ä¢	Access favorites from the Favorite List submenu.
6.	Playing Music
‚Ä¢	Choose songs or playlists to ‚Äúplay.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Although this is a simulation, the interface will respond as if the song is being played.
